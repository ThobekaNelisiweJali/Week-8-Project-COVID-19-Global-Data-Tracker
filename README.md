# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
This project is a comprehensive analysis and visualization of global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization of key pandemic metrics like cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

# 📊 Project Overview
The goal is to gain insights into how different countries responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing trends over time and comparing across nations.

# ✅ Objectives
Import and clean COVID-19 global data

Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Compare metrics across selected countries (Kenya, India, United States)

Visualize trends using plots and charts

Communicate key findings in an easy-to-read format

# 🗂️ Data Source
Data was sourced from Our World in Data. The dataset (owid-covid-data.csv) includes global COVID-19 statistics from the onset of the pandemic.

📌 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

# 🔍 Key Findings
Top Countries by Reported Totals
Countries like the United States, India, and Brazil have the highest total number of reported cases and deaths.

Countries with Highest Death Rate
Based on the latest available data, countries with the highest death rates include those with limited healthcare access or delayed response. This was calculated as total deaths divided by total cases.

Vaccination and New Cases Relationship
In India, an inverse relationship between vaccinations and new cases was observed, suggesting that vaccination efforts helped reduce case numbers.

# 📈 Visualizations
Line plots showing trends in total cases and deaths

Bar charts comparing top countries

Correlation analysis between vaccinations and new cases

Filtered views by country for detailed insights

# 📄 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the files.

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed (Anaconda recommended).

Open the notebook and run each cell sequentially.

Make sure the dataset owid-covid-data.csv is in the same folder.
